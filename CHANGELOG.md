# **The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX HD Changelog:**

## **v1.5.0 (Pre-Release)**
### **The "Awakening From the Dream" Update**
### **General:**
  * Created a new object for Classic Camera that focuses the camera during a map transition. This fixes classic camera bugs.
  * Rework pushable stones so that their behavior when pushed is much closer to how it is in the original games.
  * Pushable stones respawn when pushed down holes and when changing fields when classic camera is active.
  * Ice Blocks (found in underground maps in dungeon 8) respawn when chaing fields when classic camera is active.
  * Link gets a slight "push" when jumping into water. The push when walking into water was slightly reduced.
  * Throwing the rooster over land no longer causes Link to briefly slide. Throwing it over water the slide was reduced by 50%.
  * Disable the 2D directional hack when trading the fishing hook to the fisherman for the necklace/pink bra.
  * Update Bow Wow's teleportation behavior when jumping into a world teleporter. It's still not perfect but improved.
  * Play the secret sound in Richard's Villa when pushing the box to open the passage to the Slime Key.
  * Fix removing the "poking" state when poking is finished. This bugged out the jump fix hack.
  * Fix death sequence to use potion first. This fixes a "stuck in air" bug when dying/healing while flying with the rooster.
  * Fix crossing a hole reset point while flying with the rooster from storing the Z position which reset Link in the air.
  * Fix the rooster from being drawn in the background layer when borrwing it from the hen house (after dungeon 8 is complete).
  * Fix cracked tiles to always detect when Link is pushing against a stone. Sometimes pushing would prevent them from breaking.
  * Fix several caves with move stones so that their positions reset when crossing over a certain threshold.
  * Fix Marin singing, great fairy, and Dodongo Snakes to always properly reset music when leaving the current field.
  * Fix number of bushes outside Sales House O'Bananas so that there is two blocking the path instead of three.
  * Fix sequence of trading bananas to monkeys with classic camera enabled by adding monkeys to always animate list.
  * Fix the secret ending seagull chants to be evenly spaced apart like in the original game.
  * Fix the burning sound effect to have the proper sound which is a combination of two sound effects.
  * Fix the camera in Manbo's cave to not fall below the cave's main field which is just a black screen.

### **User Interface:**
  * Skipping a dialog with the Start button now rapidly scrolls the text and closes the box instead of just closing the box.
  * Rename option "Damage Screen Shake" to "Screen Shake Effects" and disable all screen shake effects when it toggled off.
  * Block pressing "Start" to open the inventory screen during a number of events and cutscenes.
  * Update the tooltips for a few in-game options to be more accurate: Enable Dialog Skip, Nothing is Missable, and No Heart Drops.
  * Fix skipping text during "question" dialogs by pressing "Start" to not cut off the text when skipping.
  
### **Items:**
  * Using some items will no longer stop the player while using: Magic Powder, Fire Rod, Bow & Arrow, Bombs, and throwing objects.
  * The Boomerang item has been reworked so that it can collect multiple items on a single throw.
  * Increase the size of the damage box of Magic Powder to the width or height of a tile (or 16 pixels, depends on direction).
  * Magic Powder can no longer hit grass. Bushes and grass share an object so they also share hit types so they need filtering code.
  * Running with Pegasus Boots can now smash large crystals without needing the sword equipped.
  * Fire spawned from Magic Rod shots added to the "always animate" list so despawns when outside of the current viewport.
  * Bombs have been added to the "always animate" list which allows them to explode when outside of the current viewport.
  * Items will no longer stop Link from moving when using them on 2D maps (bow, hookshot, boomerang, etc).
  * Fix playing the "holding" animation when jumping onto the Level 2 sword sprite after turning in 20 shells in Seashell Mansion.
  * Fix powerup status between map transitions. It is kept when current/next map are both either a cave or a dungeon.
  * Fix being able to fire projectiles outside of several 2D maps (such as the "Bridge" map and "Seashell Mansion").
  * Fix hookshot from occasionally firing extremely fast if pressed at just the right time by adding a small cooldown of 75ms.
  * Fix shield appearing on Link when swallowed by a Like-Like. It will now properly disappear and reappear depending on equipped status.
  * Fix the instruments to have collision against projectiles (boomerang, hookshot, etc). 
  * Fix Link's facing direction when teleporting with the ocarina on the overworld using Manbo's song then saving/loading the game.

### **Enemies:**
  * Defeated enemies and effects are added to "always animate" list. This prevents frozen effects if knocked out of current viewport.
  * Reduce fairy spawn rate of Ghini to 10% (from 75%) and allow it to drop other items at normal drop rates.
  * Increase the knockback of the Flame Fountain on the way to dungeon 8 so the player can't force their way through with boots.
  * Update "stunned" state of several enemies to either lose their damage field while stunned or gain it back as soon as stun ends.
  * Don't respawn Spiny Beetle carry object when grabbing it and throwing it into a hole when Classic Camera is active.
  * When fighting the boss Angler Fish in dungeon 4, a barrier is spawned at the top of the arena to prevent leaving.
  * Hardhat Beetle respawns when pushed down a hole, leaving the room, and re-entering. Modern camera shows special respawn effects.
  * Remove activation range check from Pols Voice, Red Zol, and Gel. They will become active when entering the field they are on.
  * Change enemy Piranha collision types to "non-water" type like the Water Tektites in dungeon 4. This collision only blocks them.
  * Disable the hit component of some minibosses until the boss is enaged: Rolling Bones, Cue Ball, and Hinox.
  * Fix the burning state to reset when changing fields in classic camera. Enemy should return to normal state and remove burn.
  * Fix enemy Antifairy to properly remove its damage field when burning it with Magic Powder.
  * Fix enemy Arm Mimic to get stunned when throwing objects (like pots) at them.
  * Fix enemy Arm Mimic to be invincible to Magic Powder.
  * Fix enemy Bomber to have unique death with Magic Powder that spawns a fairy 100% of the time. Magic rod spawns fairy 50% of the time.
  * Fix enemy Bombite to bounce off the sword when held outward in a charge state without the sword being put away afterwards.
  * Fix enemy Cheep Cheep from launching the player if jumped on just right while slightly in the water.
  * Fix enemy Gel to properly respawn when changing fields in classic camera instead of burning to death off screen.
  * Fix enemy Goomba to lose it's collision box when set on fire.
  * Fix enemy Hardhat Beetle to be able to be killed using bombs. This also spawns a bomb after death. Also remove initial idle delay.
  * Fix enemy Keese to not be affected by conveyor belts. Dungeon 3 is about the only place this is relevant.
  * Fix enemy Leevers from spawning on the ledges above the cave in the desert where Link can't reach by adding collision.
  * Fix enemy Pincer stun state, when it can deal damage, activation range, and replicate narrow window to kill instantly with powder.
  * Fix enemy Red Zol to spawn Gels in classic camera after burning and respawning with a field change.
  * Fix enemy Sea Urchin to deal damage from the side when blocking with the shield. This has been broken since v1.3.3.
  * Fix enemy Spiny Beetle crashing the game when carrying its carried object from the current field in classic camera.
  * Fix enemy Spiny Beetle AI behavior to act much closer to how they do in the original game.
  * Fix enemy Vacuum from causing Link to get stuck in a specific direction if it fell outside the camera viewport.
  * Fix enemy Zombies from spawning inside the walls near the graveyard by adding collision inside the walls.
  * Fix miniboss Dodongo Snakes from resetting current music to dungeon music while they were not encountered.
  * Fix miniboss Smasher when both Link and him pick up the ball simultaneously. Also the ball spawns a fairy when destroyed.
  * Fix boss Angler Fish arena camera to not fall below the boss field which is just a black screen.
  * Fix boss Evil Eagle cutscene to play at the same position on the ladder as the original game instead of on top of the tower.
  * Fix boss Hardhit Beetle shots to despawn when hitting the wall so they don't fly into the ethos.
  * Fix boss DethI arms falling behind the shadow layer around the Egg boss room by removing the shadow layer.

### **Overworld:**
  * The fisherman on the boat on the "Bridge" map is now drawn on a lower layer than Link so his sprite is always behind Link.
  * Prevent players from jumping to Marin when stuck on the bridge by adding an invisible barrier, forcing hookshot usage.
  * When the mountain bridge photo sequence starts, if holding the rooster it is now dropped before the sequence starts.
  * In the cave passage to Tal Tal Mountain range, respawn the skull in the room with the large hookshot gap and chest.
  * Reduce the one-way bridge collider depth to 3 (from 4) which allows throwing the flying rooster and still crossing it.
  * Add a secret sound to the shortcut passageway near Level 4 when pushing the rock into the hole and creating a shortcut.
  * Fix the stone in the forest passageway to the bat (Li'l Devil/Mad Batter, whatever you want to call it) to play the secret sound.
  * Fix trading the stick to Tarin for the honeycomb. Talking to him would just show a message that says "error".
  * Fix bushes to show the proper smoke graphics and sound effects when sprinkling Magic Powder on them.
  * Fix bushes & rocks from respawning that cover stairs when changing fields when classic camera is active.
  * Fix bushes & rocks that open up into passageways to play the "secret sound" when revealing the staircase.
  * Fix the dresser in the Raft House to have the same interaction message as all other dressers.
  * Fix several tiles of land north of the lake near Dungeon 3 to be diggable. Trying to dig them with the shovel would repel it.
  * Fix visible tiles in the desert cave that make it apparent there is a secret room in the cave.
  * Fix Tal Tal Mountain Range hole entry into the water cave to show a "falling" entry instead of just appearing in the cave.
  * Fix the cave where the Magnifying Lens is to not hide Bow Wow's chain before grabbing the Magnifying Lens.
  * Fix visibility of rooms behind bombable walls in a cave near pig moblins and a cave on the mountain with shallow water.
  * Fix missing stairs object in the same mountain cave with bombable wall which slows down movement when walking on stairs.
  * Fix collision above the cave just north of Mr. Write's house. With standard camera Moblins would often walk into the cliff.
  * Fix collision blockers in a cave on the way to level 8 dungeon with a large gap. Flying could move the camera to a bad field.
  * Fix setting most enemies on fire then resetting them by transitioning fields when classic camera is enabled.

### **Dungeons:**
  * When entering a doorway that closes behind Link, push Link forward into the room like the original game did.
  * Implement three additional missing Level 4 dungeon tile puzzle variations. This port only had a single puzzle implemented.
  * Handle the situation where someone completes Level 8 dungeon before Level 7 dungeon (as in setting the correct states).
  * Dungeon doors now make the same hollow "clank" sound when poked as bombable walls like the original games.
  * Fix visible tiles in the Color Dungeon that should not have been visible near where the nightmare key was obtained.
  * Fix dungeon doors so that they consume small keys again. This was a huge game-breaking issue.
  * Fix several 2D maps in dungeon 3, dungeon 6, and dungeon 8 to not change and update Link's position on the minimap.
  * Fix dungeon 1 to remove a crystal structure that did not exit in the original game. It could also get in the way of classic camera.
  * Fix dungeon 3 bombable walls around the nightmare key room to not have cracks. This is how it was in the original game.
  * Fix dungeon 5 missing leave button that resets block positions and push multiple buttons inward towards the room to reset sooner.
  * Fix dungeon 5 hookshot anchors (koopa faces) to have collision (they have two types: hookshot collision + movement collision).
  * Fix dungeon 7 missing collision near torches and bombable wall in the small block passage in the room with the final pillar.
  * Fix dungeon 8 bombable walls around the switch to not have cracks. This is how it was in the original games.
  * Fix dungeon 8 block to be movable near a stairway in a room north of the map with the Peahat enemies.
  * Fix Egg dungeon when classic camera is enabled. Two of the paths would not take the player to the jump at the end.
  * Fix Manbo's Song when played in the Egg to teleport the player to the entrance and not the pond.

## **v1.4.9**
### **The "Beginning of the End" Update**
  * Add a new Audio option "Classic Music Cues" which slightly alters the overworld music cues to match the original game.
  * Add a new Game option "Select Last Save" which automatically selects the last accessed save when first loading the main menu.
  * Maximum game scale can now be adjusted via "Game1.lahdhmod" file. This can also enable "editor mode" more easily.
  * Stones created by object respawners are no longer respawned on a field change when Classic Camera is active. This prevents potential duplicates.
  * Cracked floors reset on field change with Classic Camera. They reset after 15 seconds with the modern camera but not with Classic Camera.
  * Holes created after chopping down a bush are now despawned on a field change when Classic Camera is enabled.
  * Digging holes with the shovel are now also reset after a field change when Classic Camera is enabled.
  * Tarin now spawns next to the honeycomb tree after Level 3 is completed rather than after collecting the stick.
  * Enemy Spiny Beetle is now respawned on a field change when Classic Camera is enabled since they do in the original game.
  * Enemy Blade Traps now use a predictive movement system rather than collision detection. This prevents movement when there shouldn't be any.
  * Reduce the detection range of sword bearing enemies from 80 down to 60 which more closely matches the original game.
  * The option "Disable Helper Messages" also blocks the dialog text for the nightmare door when missing the nightmare key.
  * Nerf the signpost maze by allowing the current sign in the sequence to be read multiple times instead of failing.
  * Bushes now deal damage when throwing them at enemies. However, they can not destroy other bushes like rocks do.
  * Flying with the rooster and then throwing it transfers some of that velocity to Link like the original game.
  * Bridge colliders (one-way colliders) no longer stop Link + rooster from flying from the water and onto the bridge.
  * Remove collision from the fisherman on the boat near the bridge since he didn't have any in the original game.
  * Fix the jump hack from preventing the dying animation from playing if the player dies while landing on the ground.
  * Fix alligator trade sequence (canned food for bananas) where Link could move and get stuck just as the can is tossed into the air.
  * Fix item sticking to Link's head if activating the toadstool immediately after picking up an item (like Piece of Power or Guardian Acorn).
  * Fix Marin's forward and rear facing jump animations. The animations existed but played the wrong frames.
  * Fix the stick being skippable by jumping over it. A collider is now spawned behind it so the player can't jump past it.
  * Fix resetting the sword charge counter when dashing with Pegasus Boots. If sword was charged and interrupted, dashing would make it flash.
  * Fix potential softlock in Animal Village with heart piece if jumping down without bombs. A skull was added to the exit that has a bomb in it.
  * Fix seashell mansion where Link should be frozen but could change his direction as the meter is counting up.
  * Fix missing Buzz Blobs near Animal Village and missing Mushroom Bomber near the river passageway close to Animal Village.
  * Fix a single tile outside of the cave to not play Animal Village music when new option "Classic Music Cues" is disabled.
  * Fix enemy Anti-Kirby vacuum sound effect to be silenced if the player dies while it happening. This prevents an endless loop of the sound.
  * Fix enemy Arm Mimic movement animations fighting between two directions when walking diagonally.
  * Fix enemy Bomber bombs to despawn when changing fields in Classic Camera. Also always spawn a fairy when killed with Boomerang.
  * Fix enemy Cheep-Cheep stomp conditions and remove its damage field component after it has been stomped.
  * Fix enemy Flame Trap flames to persist through playing the ocarina. This exploit allowed the player to skip the mirror shield requirement.
  * Fix enemy Pairodd teleport activation range to be closer to the original game. This seems to almost perfectly duplicate behaviors.
  * Fix enemy Pols Voice attack sound effects. Stun items were making the metallic "ting" sound and sword had all the wrong sound effects.
  * Fix enemy Spiny Beetle to be able to fall down holes by fixing it's size dimensions. Also fix it's reset with Classic Camera.
  * Fix dungeon 3 blocks to reset positions when walking over certain leave buttons.
  * Fix dungeon 5 blocks to reset positions when walking over certain leave buttons. Also fix door to shut after leaving passageway.
  * Fix dungeon 7 keyhole to show the "missing key" message when the player does not have the bird key.
  * Fix the Egg follower turnaround to handle the situation of holding the rooster while activating it which stuck Link in the air.
  * Fix collision of the wall behind the bird key in the cave that it is found that allowed the player to walk out of bounds. 
  * Fix collision of Kanalet Castle eastern wall. This is a v1.0.0 bug so the collision was never implemented to begin with.
  * Fix partially "visible tiles" in the Magnifying Glass cave that should not have been visible.

## **v1.4.8**
### **The "Reaching the Final Stretch" Update**
  * The "Always Animate" system has been overhauled to be safer and more reliable and more objects have been added to it.
  * Classic Camera: Turn "Classic Border" into a slider from a toggle and add "Super Game Boy" border option.
  * Classic Camera: Field transitions are now more accurate. Objects that reset on field transition now happen during the transition.
  * Classic Camera: Several objects are now respawned on field transition: grass, bushes, crystals, rocks, pots, etc.
  * Classic Camera: Throwing most destructible objects now shatter against the edge of the field.
  * Bow Wow can now be taken as a follower after Level 8 has been completed and "Nothing is Missable" is enabled.
  * Add a block reset in dungeon 2 nightmare key room with the Pols Voice, Keese, and Stalfos.
  * Dungeon 3 map has been rebuilt to be a single map instead of 4 smaller maps which had an incorrect minimap. 
  * Nightmare key is no longer consumed on usage. This is not retroactive and only works on future dungeon clears.
  * Marin can now swim in deep water. This is only possible after Level 8 and "Nothing is Missable" is enabled as Marin will join as a follower.
  * The flying rooster can now be picked up while swimming like the original game.
  * Created redrawn icons for the built-in map editor. It appears they were upscaled which made them look blurry.
  * Adjusted the formula for how 2D jump height is calculated based on how long the button is held for more variation in height.
  * Bow Wow can eat underwater fish and has a 50% chance to eat something immediately after a map loads in.
  * Created a "no followers" object that is placed on maps to disable followers rather than a hardcoded map list in the game code.
  * Fix disabling Bow Wow push and hit components immediately after rescuing him from the moblin cave.
  * Fix the bed transition when entering the dream in the Dream Shrine. Link would jump on the bed and just stand there.
  * Fix a soft lock in Seashell Mansion where the player could jump over the door and into the abyss.
  * Fix Trendy Game crane to start playing its "activation" sound immediately after picking up an item.
  * Fix playing "item get" sound when unlocking the photo album after the very first photo event.
  * Fix enemy Pairodd activation range to be closer to original game. Also conveyor belts should not affect them.
  * Fix Pairodd to not shoot a projectile immediately after resetting the room they are in when classic camera is active.
  * Fix some incorrect positions of enemies on different maps and fix them activating too soon.
  * Fix dungeon teleporters to drop an item when teleportation to begins. This affected all dungeons except (old) dungeon 3 and dungeon 7.
  * Fix dungeon 2 room with a Spark and dungeon barriers where the Spark wouldn't take the correct path.
  * Fix dungeon 6 door condition by room near entrance with 3 Wizzrobes. It is now possible to exit through that door later on.
  * Fix miniboss music continuing to play when leaving the room and it wasn't defeated. Affects Dodongo Snakes (dungeon 3/6/8) and Hinox (dungeon 7).
  * Fix similar but slightly different miniboss scenarios: Lanmola (from the desert) and Turtle Rock (entrance to dungeon 8).
  * Fix various stones/blocks in different maps that should either be or not be pushable compared to original game.
  * Fix cucco attack swarm to stop on field transition, not freeze on the screen edge (both classic camera), and reset the attack counter when done.
  * Fix a potential "hitch" in the air when falling jumping/falling into 2D maps from a hole above (such as dungeon 1 Moldorm pit).
  * Fix keyboard keys when in editor mode to actually map to a real keyboard.
  * Many other small fixes and tweaks spread out everywhere. This version had too many changes to keep track of everything.

## **v1.4.7**
### **The "Feature Complete" Update**
  * Implement system to reset enemy positions when changing fields when Classic Camera is enabled.
  * Options menus finally have tooltips implemented. Press the top face button on the controller to view them.
  * Pressing LT/RT to change the scale can now be held down to rapidly shift through scaling values.
  * Dark rooms in dungeons 2, 6, and 8 have been made slightly darker to encourage powder usage.
  * Fix scale changes during Classic Camera. The controller buttons are supposed to be blocked when it's active.
  * Fix regression of some of the "always animate" objects to not hang around after death.
  * Fix "ghost" Ravens from somehow activating between map transitions (related to above fix).
  * Fix sword charging NPC avoidance to not detect NPCs that are currently not active on the game field.
  * Fix even more animation quirks when jumping > landing > performing action for both 2D and 3D Link.
  * Fix the shield from interacting with and bouncing against gravestones that spawn Ghini enemies. 
  * Fix missing collision field in the top left corner of Kanalet Castle upstairs map.
  * Fix Stalfos enemies getting stuck in a nearby field when damage launching them into it.
  * Fix transitional weirdness when Classic Camera is enabled on the "bridge" map (the one with the fisherman under the bridge).
  * Fix missing pushable component on Goponga Flowers which made it so the shield does not "bump" off of them.
  * Fix Spark hitbox so it's somewhat closer to the original game (differences mean it is not perfect).

## **v1.4.6**
### **The "Stayin' Alive" Update**
  * The "always animate" code has been optimized and updated to be far more reliable and is also applied to the "normal" camera.
  * Added several more objects to the always animate list: projectiles, boos, falling rocks, butterflies, crows, ravens, and more.
  * Reworked the code for picking up objects. Instant pickups work with a button tap, full animation works, and fixes issues with Spiny Beetles.
  * Reworked the code for Ocarina listening and fixed an issue with playing the ocarina a tile down from the Egg with Classic Camera.
  * Enemy Crows and Ravens now despawn after they fly so far away from Link's current position instead of persisting forever.
  * Enemy Ravens now have a 1 second start delay after the map load to prevent some weird transition bugs.
  * When Link "drowns" in either water without flippers or within lava tiles, he is pushed further into the water/lava.
  * Fix animation issues with Link when landing + performing 1 of these actions on the same frame: magic powder, boomerang, or poking.
  * Fix enemy Spiny Beetle from repelling the sword while vulnerable. It could still be attacked so this bug was strange.
  * Fix enemy falling rock spawners to not reach over into the egg stairs when using the normal camera.
  * Fix several cave map terrains where cliffs pop through the surrounding darkness.
  * Fix Kanalet castle from acting as a "dungeon" object and showing a blank map.
  * Fix shadow tiles overwriting ground tiles in Dungeons 1, 2, and 6.
  * Fix issues with rounding errors for the cloud textures in Dungeon 7 boss map. 
  * Fix misplaced eyegore statue in Dungeon 4. This statue is located just above the flippers chest.
  * Fix Classic Camera + Dungeon Only options to work when inside the egg and the now "not dungeon" castle.

## **v1.4.5**
### **The "Even More Maintenance" Update**
  * More Classic Camera fixes: Keep more objects "alive" offscreen, fix navigating the egg, disable during the ending.
  * Add "lahdmod" support for the textbox and the HUD. These can be used to customize the size and positions.
  * Start to skip dialog boxes won't skip options. Options can only be selected with the confirm button.
  * Implement the Flying Roosters jump that he does when Link jumps or jumps off walls.
  * Objects that have instant pickup such as Flying Rooster, Spiny Beetle, Genie Lamp, Balls, etc. are now actually instantly.
  * Fix jumping > landing > walking appearing as if Link is sliding across the ground briefly.

  * Update teleport transition in Dungeon 6 while Classic Camera is enabled to be quicker and have a scrolling effect.
  * Slightly increase the Ocarina listener rectangle for objects that require playing the ocarina.
  * Vacuum enemies can no longer be killed with sword shots and fix a bug where direction can get stuck if killing while vacuuming.
  * Fix crash with Marin-Walrus sequence and slightly adjust the parameters so it works with Classic Camera.
  * Fix crash when returning the ghost to his grave. This is the same crash as with Marin and I have no idea why it started happening.
  * Fix BowWow from getting stuck in a previous field when Classic Camera is enabled.
  * Fix several maps that did not spawn BowWow. Also fix it so a "ghost BowWow" does not spawn.
  * Fix the water under lilypads in Goponga Swamp to be animated.
  * Fix ball playing children music change to change back when changing fields when Classic Camera is enabled.
  * Fix push block on the way to the feather in Dungeon 1 to have the correct push directions (was stuck towards door).
  * Fix Lower Face Shrine mural sequence to not close out the image prematurely allowing the dialog to finish.
  * Fix misplaced collider on Tal Tal Mountain Range just under the bird key cave near the triple waterfalls.
  * Fix Dungeon 7 pillars so that they can be hit from behind with the ball.
  * Fix Dungeon 7 boss Evil Eagle issues: classic camera, freezing player during intro, attack locking, and reduce fly away time.
  * Fix mountain photo bridge sequence to work with Classic Camera mode.

## **v1.4.3**
### **The "Nostalgic Screen-Effect" Update**
  * Scaling has been reworked to scale based on the resolution of the original game. Game scale now goes to 20x.
  * Implement a "Classic Camera" that aims to replicate the screen-scrolling based system of the original game.
  * Add a classic camera option "Dungeon Only" which only applies it when inside of dungeons.
  * Implemented a "graying out" system for currently invalid options. For example, some options don't work with classic camera (and vice versa).
  * Movement has been modified to be more like the original game. "Classic Movement" option only restores the ability to "moonwalk" (walk backwards).
  * Jump height is now variable when holding the button down longer when on 2D maps.
  * When charging + jumping, a brief "standing" animation is played in between so Link doesn't appear to "slide".
  * Boomerang can now be thrown in any direction at any point. It now relies on controller direction instead of Link's current direction.
  * Dungeon 7 tower state is now reflected in the overworld. When all pillars are destroyed, it appears shorter.
  * Falling down a hole in the bird key cave now leads back to the waterfall below it on the overworld.
  * Marin's singing is now based on field rectangle instead of distance. This is more accurate to the original game.
  * Freeze the game while teleporting after playing Manbo's song. Game resumes when teleportation ends.
  * Instruments can no longer be collected with items like the Boomerang and Hookshot.
  * When adjusting scale with the controller, it should now save when quitting. Previously it only saved when adjusting from menus.
  * Zombies no longer spawn when the game is currently frozen such as playing ocarina or when owl is speaking.
  * Remove Hardhat beetle initialize state which did nothing. This affected classic camera where it would just stand there for a bit.
  * Fix playing the jumping "flip" animation when cancelling a sword charge while in air.
  * Fix the "falling" animation while in 2D mode. It should play a flip even when not jumping.
  * Fix diving and then walking to land causing permanent invincibility until walking into the water again.
  * Fix another animation quirk when attacking then jumping as the animation finishes which would cause Link to stand in air.
  * Fix boomerang and hookshot when collecting fairies to not sometimes blast them into outer space.
  * Fix a black spot on the overworld where there should have been ocean on Tal Tal Mountain Range.
  * Fix partial tiles popping up in the edges of some caves.
  * Fix playing ocarina + quitting to cause 8 seconds of invinciblity when game resumes.
  * Fix the white fade out effect when using a dungeon teleporter after playing Manbo's song.
  * Fix dungeon minimap to properly scale with UI scaling. I missed this when fixing main map and inventory.
  * Fix instance in Dungeon 1 and Dungeon 6 where Link should be able to squeeze through but couldn't in this port.
  * Fix Dungeon 2 and Dungeon 6 minimap chest locations.
  * Fix missing tiles in Dungeon 5 map. 
  * Fix Dungeon 5 crystal structure hitboxes so they don't interrupt sword and so they can be smashed from more angles.
  * Fix Dungeon 5 Gohma miniboss to behave accurately to the original games when playing the ocarina.
  * Fix Dungeon 6 instrument room door closing behind the player after the instrument has been collected.
  * Fix falling through certain flying tiles in Dungeon 6 that are covering up holes.
  * Fix a door in dungeon 7 floor 1 blocked by a barrier to actually stop Link from crossing it when it's up.
  * Fix Dungeon 7 room with horse heads so that they can not leave the room. Previously they could then they would bug out.

## **v1.4.2**
### **"On the Road to Glory" Update**
  * Note: Classic Camera has not made it into this release as it still needs more work.
  * Implement Indonesia language + textures. Thanks to [PangranggaCLAMP](https://github.com/PangranggaCLAMP) (creator).
  * Exclusive Fullscreen mode has finally been fixed! There is a slight delay entering it when booting the game with it enabled.
  * Huge map overhaul: add all the missing details of "upper levels" instead of "black" nothingness.
  * Initial window size has been modified to be a 6x integer scale of the original game's resolution (+widescreen).
  * Add more sword beam options to "ObjLink.lahdmod" file. Needs to be redownloaded from "Discussions" page.
  * Update several maps so that their fields line up with with the "screens" of the original games.
  * Make all photo sequences time out instead of waiting for a button press to prevent accidental skips.
